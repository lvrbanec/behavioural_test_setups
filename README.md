# Behavioural test setups

Behavioural tests setups created to test cognitive abilities of wild shrews (Sorex araneus).
Setups were modelled FreeCAD and automatized with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 

Here I provide the 3D modells as well as the code.


** Half of the setups where created at the Max Planck Insitute (MPI) for Animal Behavior (Radolfzell, Germany) and therefore, belong to this insitution. For reuse of setup in research or industry please acquire consensus from MPI.
